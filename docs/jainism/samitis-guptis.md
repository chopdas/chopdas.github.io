# Five Samitis and Three Guptis

Besides the [[Panch Maha Vratas]] that form the 12 vows for the layman, Jainism observes five rules of code of conducts (Samitis) to purify the actions and make them faultless and three rules of avoidance of misconduct (Guptis) which are prohibitions against sinful activities. Collectively the 8 virtues are known as અસ્થ-પ્રવચન-મત.

૫ સમિતિ:
1.  ઇરિયા - regulation of walking carefully so as not to cause any pain or death of any living being.
2.  ભાસા - regulation of speaking by using sinless and concise speed, and to avoid the eight faults during conversation: anger, pride, deceit, greed, laughter, fear, gossip, and slander.
3.  એશન્ના - regulation of begging. Monks should search and obtain foods and other articles necessary for use, and to use them in a faultless manner.
4.  આદન નીક્ષેપન - regulation of taking or keeping an article of use very carefully so as not to endanger the life of small creatures and insects.
5.  ઉતસર્ગ / પરિસ્થાપનિકા - regulation of disposal of waste things, such as mucus, urine, stools and other items in a solitary and out of the way place in a proper manner so as not to cause any inconvenience to anybody. This waste helps the growth of germs, and is also the indirect cause of their death.
