## Background

આરતિ

-   Ä + Rati - Experience the spiritual joy (Rati) from (Ä) all directions.
-   End of Art (misery)
    

The practice of આરતિ and મંગળદિવો started around 12th Century AD by the inspiration of આચારય હેમચંદ્રજિ. He inspired the then Hindu રાજા કુમારપાલ with teaching of non-violence and true meaning of religion. કુમારપાલ started the practice of આરતિ and દિવો. Hence the મંગળદિવો names કુમારપલ in the song. The આરતિ was written by શેઠ મુળચંદ of ધુદેવા (કેસરયજિા) in Räjasthan. (કેસરયજિા) is a Jain pilgrimage where the આદેશ્વરભગવાન is the main પ્રતિમા in black marble.

મુળચંદ worshipped and performed આરતિ at the કેસરયજિા temple. He was deeply devoted to આદેશ્વરભગવાન, and in his old age he had to move to another village. He could not bare the separation, and at that time the દેવ guarding the temple gave him a small piece of the actual મુર્તિ of આદેશ્વરભગવાન to pray.

We honor the extreme ભક્તી of શેઠ મુળચંદ by singing the આરતિ.

-   To free from the cycle of the material world, one needs to have bright light of [[Samitis and Guptis|five types of knowledge]].
-   To restrain negative activities of five senses and five characteristics of સંમયકદરશન. The light of the આરતિ signifies the overcoming of
	-   fear through faith (સંમયકદરશન - Right Belief)
    -   ignorance through knowledge (સંમયકજ્ઞાન - Right Knowledge)
    -   negativity through virtue (સંમયકચારિત્ર - Right Conduct)
-   We light five Dipaks as symbol of [[Panch Maha Vratas|five great vows]] to practice the [[Samitis and Guptis|five Samitis]] and five types of knowledge to attain salvation.
    -   મતિજ્ઞાન - knowledge gained through indriyas
    -   શ્રુતજ્ઞાન - Scriptural knowledge
    -   અવાધીજ્ઞાન - knowledge of material world
    -   મનપરયાયજ્ઞાન - Mind reading capability
    -   કેવળજ્ઞાન - Omniscience

These two આરતિ are done together - The first part consists of five lamps (જય જય / આદિનાથ આરતિ). The second part consists of a single lamp (મંગલદિવો).
